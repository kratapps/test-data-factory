Create sObjects in unit tests seamlessly.  

* Test Data Factory out-of-the-box creates records with all required fields already populated.
* Extend `SObjectFactory` class or add Custom Metadata to provide base records for your unit tests. This way you can ensure records pass validation rules.
* Do you need in some unit tests more customized records? Define your records using the `SObjectFactoryScenario`.
* Custom Settings and sObjects from managed packages can also be created.
